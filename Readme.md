# Task Management Backend System

## Overview
This project is a Task Management backend system built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It includes role-based access control, task assignment functionality, authentication, and rate limiting. The backend also integrates Swagger UI for interactive API documentation and testing.

---

## Features Overview

### User Registration
- Users can sign up with a username, email, and password.
- Validates email format and enforces strong password criteria.
- Optional confirmation email upon registration.

### User Login
- Registered users can log in using their credentials.
- Validates credentials and issues a JWT token.
- Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

### User Logout
- Authenticated users can log out, invalidating their JWT token.

### Get User Profile
- Retrieves profile information for authenticated users, including username, email, and roles.
- Secured endpoint accessible only to logged-in users.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Defines roles (Admin, Manager, User) with varying access levels to endpoints.
- Enforces role-based restrictions for secure access.

### Task Management
- Supports CRUD operations for tasks:
  - Create, read, update, and delete tasks with relevant fields.
- Ensures tasks are associated with users and enforces access control.

### Task Assignment
- Allows managers to assign tasks to users within their team.
- Provides endpoints to view and update assigned tasks.

### Advanced Features
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects APIs from abuse by configuring limits based on user roles.
- **Search and Filtering:** Implements search and filtering for tasks based on criteria like status and priority.

### Additional Features
- Secure authentication with JWT tokens.
- Interactive API documentation via Swagger UI.

## Setup

## Environment Variables

To run this project locally, you will need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

### Required Environment Variables

### Database Configuration
- `DB` - Database name.
- `MONGO_URI` - MongoDB connection string.

### Server Configuration
- `PORT` - Port number where the server will run (default: `3000`).
- `SECRET` - Secret key for JWT token generation.

### Email Configuration
These variables are required for email services:
